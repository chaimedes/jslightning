# jslightning
Javascript-generated phyics-based lightning
Lightning is a phenomenon that remains incompletely understood, but great strides have been made it determining its methods.
At time of writing, there were few satisfactory virtual lightning simulators easily available, with most existing ones focusing on looks rather than on function.
As a science enthusiast, I wanted to create a lightning simulator that would reflect modern understanding of how lightning functions.

This code is my attempt to do just that.
